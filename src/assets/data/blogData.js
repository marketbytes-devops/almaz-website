This type of coverage is often inexpensive but offers little protection if anything of value is damaged or lost.",

With FVP, the moving company is responsible for repairing, replacing, or reimbursing you for the current market value of any items that are damaged, lost, or destroyed during the move. While this type of coverage is more expensive, it offers greater peace of mind, especially for valuable or fragile items.",
